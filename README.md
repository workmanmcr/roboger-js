  }
  neighbor(6)
  Expected outcome [0, 'beep', 'boop', "Won't you be my neighbor?", 4, 5, 6]

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Clone the repository or download the code files._
* _Open the `index.html` file in a web browser._
* _In the web browser, you will see an input field where you can enter a number. This number represents the maximum value for the range of numbers to be processed._
* _Click the "ROBOGERFY IT!!" button to execute the Neighbor Function._
* _The output will be displayed below the input field, showing the processed numbers based on the rules of the Neighbor Function._
